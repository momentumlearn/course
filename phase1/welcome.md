## ðŸ’» Today's Project: Git It

Complete [Git-It](https://github.com/jlord/git-it-electron), a tutorial program that will walk you through the basics of Git and GitHub.

To install it, run:
`brew install git-it`

This should put the Git-it program in your `/Applications` folder. You can start it by pressing command-spacebar on your Mac and typing "git-it" and hitting return when you see the icon.

Git-it will tell you to install Github Desktop. You do not have to install this, although you can if you want. We won't be using it in class.

The first time you run Git-it, you may get a notice that the application is from an unknown developer. If you do, right-click on the application and then choose "Open." You will be presented with a dialog -- choose to run the application.

Once the application is running, read the instructions and complete the tasks in Git-it. Completion of the project is the link to the pull request that you will make in the second-to-last Git-It task.

Your link should look similar to this, with a different number at the end: `https://github.com/jlord/patchwork/pull/37062`

[Submit the link to your pull request url using this form](https://forms.gle/hKL37abHZ7TEoyWT6).
