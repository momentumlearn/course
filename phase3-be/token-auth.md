## Objectives

- API project review
- Token authentication in DRF with Djoser
- Git Workflow for Teams

## 🎯 Collaborative Project

Work with your team. Today you should be writing code for your **models** referring to the diagram you made. Be sure to test out your models in the Django shell and/or admin to see if they work the way you intend. Once you have models in place you can begin work on endpoints.

- 📺 [Finally Understand Auth in DRF - a Will Vincent talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pY-oje5b5Qk) -> Will isn't using the Djoser library but he does a great job of reviewing different auth strategies and why you would choose one or the other. Watch this for a better understanding and overview of authentication.
