### Database GUIs

- [DB Browser for SQLite](https://sqlitebrowser.org/)
- [Postico for Postgres](https://eggerapps.at/postico/)
- [DBeaver - Universal Database Tool](https://dbeaver.io/) - This is much more complex than you may need but it is interesting.

### Models

- [List of all Django Reference content related to Models](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/4.1/ref/models/)
- [Don't forget! Django Best Practices: Custom User Model](https://learndjango.com/tutorials/django-custom-user-model)
- [Django Docs: Saving Model Instances](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/4.1/ref/models/instances/#saving-objects)

### Managers and QuerySets

- [Django Model Managers](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/4.1/topics/db/managers)
- [Django Related Objects Reference](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/4.1/ref/models/relations/#related-objects-reference)
- [Django QuerySets](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/4.1/topics/db/queries/#retrieving-objects)

### Queries

You can think of queries like questions you ask about your data, phrased in a way that the database can answer. Django has a built-in library (the Django ORM) that lets us do all the CRUD actions we need for our application, and more.

- [Django Queries: Retrieving Objects](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/4.1/topics/db/queries/#retrieving-objects)
- [Django Queries: Field lookups](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/4.1/topics/db/queries/#field-lookups)
- [Django Queries: Lookups that span relationships](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/4.1/topics/db/queries/#lookups-that-span-relationships)
- [Django Queries: Lookups with Related objects](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/4.1/topics/db/queries/#related-objects)

## ðŸŒŸ EXTRA/TMI

_Links in this section are really more information than you need right now, but it's relevant and interesting. Things included here are good to know but ok to save for later._

- [What is SQL?](https://www.techtarget.com/searchdatamanagement/definition/SQL)
- [SQL Basics: Learn X in Y minutes](https://learnxinyminutes.com/docs/sql/) -> this is a helpful reference for SQL syntax when you run into it. You do not need to write SQL for Django because the Django ORM does it for you, and it does it well. The Django docs often illustrate queries made by the ORM using SQL syntax, however, and you will find it helpful in your job to know the basics.
