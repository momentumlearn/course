## Views

### Class-based Views

- [Class-based vs. function-based views](https://simpleisbetterthancomplex.com/article/2017/03/21/class-based-views-vs-function-based-views.html) _This is about Django views in general, not specific to DRF._
- [DRF Docs: Class-based views](https://www.django-rest-framework.org/api-guide/views/) _This talks about `APIView`_.

### Generic Views

- [DjangoCon 2019: Generic View? What Is That and Why Would I Use It?, Felipe Lee](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmKowZNmkCo) _Again about class-based views in Django but the explanation is relevant to what you will see in DRF._
