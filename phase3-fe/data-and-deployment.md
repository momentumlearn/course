## Objectives

- Check in on project progress
- Finding & fixing bugs in your project
- Deploying to [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/with/react/)

## 🎯 Project

The React Trivia application is due on {{ site.data.projects.react_trivia.due_date | date: "%A, %B %e" }}. It should meet at least the **minimum functional requirements** and must be **deployed to Netlify.** 🚀

**Minimum functional requirements:**

- A user can see a list of categories.
- A user can select one category.
- A user can see questions for that category, with answer options for each question.
- A user can select an answer for a question.
- A user can see if that answer is the correct answer.
- A user can go back to the category list and start over.

**It would be awesome if:**

- The answers are shuffled so that the correct answer is not always in the same position.
- The questions are shown one at a time instead of all at once, and the user is able to advance through the set of questions.
- A user can see how many questions they answered correctly (or some kind of score) when they have answered all the questions in a category.
