## âœ… TODO: Create tasks on your Trello board today

Your team's Trello board is ready with columns predefined to start you off. You are welcome to adapt it and create additional columns to support the way your team works.

You should put your user stories on your Trello board in the User Stories column. You'll find a template card for user stories that you can copy if you want.

Then, break them down into tasks and put tasks on cards.

### How to make cards

- Task cards go in the Backlog column.
- Use the Task Card template.
- One task per card
- Each task should be doable in a day or less.
- Don't assign tasks to anyone yet.
- Link a task back to its user story card using the User Story field.
- Each card must include how you will know when the task is done (its "definition of done").
