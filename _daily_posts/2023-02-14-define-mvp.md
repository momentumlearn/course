## âœ… TODO for your project team today

### 1. Post your team charter in your team's Slack channel.

Please pin or bookmark it at the top of the channel so that it can be referenced easily.

### 2. What is your app and what does it do?

Your first and most important goal today is to answer that question.

### 3. Clearly define your team's Minimum Viable Product (MVP).

Talk through features your app might have and then narrow them down to the most essential.
