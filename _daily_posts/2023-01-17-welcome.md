## How the Advanced Phase Works

During this phase, there are separate meetings and topics for front-end and back-end development. See the [schedule]({% link schedule.md %}) for details.

Your team meets either during the morning or the afternoon. The rest of the day is project time, so we'll expect to see you online and working. Please let us know if you will be unavailable during work hours.

During project time, please **read/watch/listen to the required readings, videos, and podcasts** and **work on your projects**. Come to meetings prepared to ask questions.

You are welcome to use the team Zoom meeting and/or [the co-working Zoom]({{ site.zoom_coworking_link }}) during project work hours.

## ðŸ¤¨ What does "Advanced" Even Mean?

We don't expect you to *know* how to do anything in Phase 3. We do expect you use all the resources at your disposal to *figure it out*.

You can't learn how to code by studying or memorizing. The only way to learn is to write code -- and you have to do that before you really understand it. By trying things, and running code, you learn what code does and how it works. Experience is built on doing the work.
