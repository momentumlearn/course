## üóìÔ∏è Today's Topics

We will use all day today for plan for the collaborative project. Katie will open breakout rooms at 9:30 and at 2:00 for folks to meet with their teams and work on project planning. You will not need to write code today.

## üéØ Collaborative Project

This week you will begin work on a project with both front- and back-end teammates. This project is due at the end of the Phase. We have a little extra time in this Phase because of the three extra days during Thanksgiving week. That means I'm expecting teams to have time to _at least attempt_ a spicy feature or two. üå∂Ô∏è

The front-end will build a React application that will make AJAX requests to the back-end application built with Django and Django REST Framework. There are no strict rules about who works on front-end or back-end, so your team can decide how best to use your resources.

Your team can choose between two projects. They will _both_ give you practice doing what you have been doing (building an API or building a React application based around CRUD functionality) but they present some different problems to solve.

Choose the one that sounds more fun or interesting to you.

### Options

#### Social ECards

- [Project description](https://github.com/momentum-projects/group--social-cards/blob/main/README.md)
- [Social ECards assignment invitation](https://classroom.github.com/a/Z0G2d6pz)

#### QuestionBox

- [Project description](https://github.com/momentum-projects/group--questionbox/blob/main/README.md)
- [QuestionBox assignment invitation](https://classroom.github.com/a/1OeNw25N)

#### How to accept the assignment and create the repos on GitHub

The back end will work in their own repo and the front end will work in their own repo, so for the same project each team will have _two_ repos.

**One back-end dev** should accept the assignment invitation and name the team something like "Team Yeti Back-end" (whatever your team name is!). Then the other back-end dev(s) should accept the assignment and choose the right team. All back-end folks on the team clone that same repo.

**One front-end dev** should accept the assignment invitation and name the team something like "Team Yeti Front-end" (whatever your team name is!). Then the other front-end dev(s) should accept the assignment and choose the right team. All front-end folks on the team clone that same repo.

Tomorrow (Tuesday) you will learn how to work with others in a shared repo. Today you should not need to commit or push any code since your main goal is **planning**.

‚ö†Ô∏è Note: If you run into trouble making the repos or getting access, we will sort this all out tomorrow. It should not be necessary to create a repo until you have done the planning, so don't worry if something goes sideways on the repos today. We'll fix it!

When you do start work in this repo, you should delete the README at the root so it doesn't conflict with the files you will create for the project. You can save it somewhere else -- it's just a Markdown file. When you start your Django or React app, you should **create it at the root of the repo directory, not in a subdirectory** (you do this by specifying the current directory with a `.` instead of a project name). This will make deploying easier.

### The Teams

### How to work as one team
{:.section}

Even though you have two separate codebases and separate applications, you're working together to ship a single product on time. You can make product decisions together even though you will implement features separately.

We'll check in on the projects in class; front and back end teams will continue to meet separately.

Remember to **read the README carefully**.

### ü•Ö Your Goals Today ü•Ö

- [Create a Slack channel](https://slack.com/help/articles/201402297-Create-a-channel) and name it your team's name. Add all team members and instructors to it.
- Decide which project you want to do.
- Understand the project requirements thoroughly and discuss what you need to build.
- Outline a detailed plan for what you'll need to do.
    - Front end will need to sketch out the **[user flow](https://signalvnoise.com/posts/1926-a-shorthand-for-designing-ui-flows)** and [draw up some **wireframes**](https://xd.adobe.com/ideas/process/wireframing/wireframe-design-101/) for the application. It can help to ask questions like:
        - What does our user see when they first land on our site?
        - What will they need to do here?
        - How will they accomplish that?
        - What will happen next?
        - If they click on a button or link, what happens?
        - What does the UI look like after the user clicks on something / follows a link / submits a form?
    - Back end will need to draw ER diagrams to plan out the **models** and start a list of **endpoints** you think you will need. It can help to ask questions like:
        - What are the _nouns_ in your project requirements? These are likely models.
        - What data will you need to save in your database so you can look it up again later?
        - What information will the front end need so they can accomplish the UI that they are planning?
        - What permissions will need to be in place?
- **WRITE YOUR PLANS DOWN.** You can use any tools you like as long as the content you create is shareable. Some tools that might be useful: Trello, Google Docs, Excalidraw, Miro. Make sure everyone on your team has access to this documentation.
- You are encouraged to work with other front or back end devs on other teams to share ideas, solutions, and resources.
- Come to your front- or back-end class meeting prepared to give progress reports and ask for help on what you're working on.

We haven't yet covered everything you'll need to be able to do this project, so that will be our task this week and next.

## What everyone should have done by tomorrow

### Back end developers

- ER Diagrams
- A list of endpoints
- A good initial plan for the JSON you think you will need to return

### Front end developers

- A detailed user flow plan/diagram
- Detailed wireframes
- A good initial plan of the components you think you will need

### Git Workflow

Working with other developers in a shared codebase means that the workflow you've been using so far will have to change. **We will cover this in class together on Tuesday.** If you want to get a head start, here are the slides for reference.
