Working on a software engineering team requires a great deal of skill, and not just on the technical side. The skills you need to collaborate successfully can be learned and practiced and can grow over time. [This short video explains why a growth mindset in a professional context is valuable to employers and employees alike](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r0qpJxEhOP4).

The purposes of peer feedback include:

- to encourage folks to keep doing what is helpful and productive for the team
- to demonstrate how one's actions affect others
- to highlight specific areas to practice and improve on in Phase 4 and beyond

Honest feedback is valuable when offered respectfully and in the spirit of kindness and cooperation. Creating software is a team sport!
